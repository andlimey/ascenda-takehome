        "The women staff at fresh restaurant were unhelpful and unfriendly. I booked for grand deluxe 2 bed bay view non smoking but they gave me a smoking grand deluxe room instead. The room stinks so bad my aunt and my mom and myself could not sleep. I have asthma, and that makes it more even worst. All night i have palpitations and could hardly breathe. And the chocolate in a small box that is suppose to be a welcoming gift was empty and whoever among the staff who took/ate the chocolate Had the decency to leave the wrapper inside the box. I'm not a big fan of those welcoming chocolate gift since i am not a chocolate freak myself but hopefully the hotel manager will read this and perhaps make him/her more aware and be more vigilant in checking or monitoring your staff activities. This is bad for business especially for foreign guests. This is a 4 star hotel...but the service is so poor and disappointing and I do not wish to come back into this hotel ever again.",

        "Average would be a great word to sum up my experience. The price is a little high for a hotel delivering mediocre service. The staff was ok. The hotel is newer and clean. The atmosphere was a little cold and unfriendly. The breakfast buffet was very good though. Good location near the airport and mall of Asia. Smoking in casino may bother some people.",

        "This is a beautiful hotel, casino resort. It truly is 5 star. Only thing that is disappointing is the smell of cigarettes everywhere. Being from Australia, where smoking is banned almost everywhere, it's a shame this place doesn't have enclosed space for smoking so the non smoking gambling people can breath without inhaling second hand cancerous fumes. This place really needs it and should realize there are a lot more non smoking gamblers than the smoking ones. The non smoking gamblers have more money as well.",
